# Day 01

- Why Go?
- Introduce Goroutines (Power of Go)
  - GOMAXPROCS
  - sync.WaitGroup
  - Go scheduler
  - Deadlock detection
- Garbage collector
- `go build` and `go run`
  - binaries (`GOOS` & `GOARCH` / `CGO_ENABLED`)
- Setting up Go environment: $GOPATH & $PATH
  - Including setting up VSCode
  - Setting up delve debugger (optional)
  - Check using `101-workshop` repo `README.md` (https://github.com/Chennai-Golang/101-workshop)
- Syntax overview!
  - Going through 'Tour of Go' site:
    - Variables, packages and functions
      - Multiple Returns
      - Named return values
        - `defer`
      - Zero values
      - Type conversions
      - Type inference
      - Constants
        - Constants in standard library
        - Used as enums (https://golang.org/pkg/time/#pkg-constants)
    - Flow control
      - For
        - as `while`
        - range
        - forever
      - if
        - with statements (https://tour.golang.org/flowcontrol/6)
      - defers
        - stack based execution (https://tour.golang.org/flowcontrol/13)
      - Switch statements (https://gobyexample.com/switch)
        - no break
        - statements are optional
        - top-down execution - where execution stops after a case succeeds
    - More types
      - Pointers
      - Struct Fields
      - Imports / Exports
      - Pointers & structs
      - Arrays
      - Slices (https://gobyexample.com/slices)
        - how they affect the underlying array
        - `len` and `capacity`
      - Ranges (https://gobyexample.com/range)
      - Functions (https://golang.org/doc/codewalk/functions/)
    - Methods and interfaces
      - Methods and pointer indirection
      - Receiver functions
        - pointer receivers vs value receivers
      - interfaces
        - implicit implementation
        - empty interface
    - `init` function
    - Recovering from a panic using `recover` (https://blog.golang.org/defer-panic-and-recover)
- Setting up `dep` and learning about the `bin` directory
  - Usage of `dep` as a package manager
