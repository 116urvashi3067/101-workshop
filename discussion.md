## Workshop time
* 8 hours

## Time breakdown
* Setup, helloworld - (mail them to do it)
* Setup, Introduction and helloworld - 45min

## Use case
* Building a scrapers using (https://github.com/anaskhan96/soup)

## Project flow
1. Scrape all the items one by one form source url
    1. Data types, keywords
    2. Struct types
    3. Print the output on screen with time taken
2. After sequentially scraping, introduce coroutines to show how to make it concurrent/fast
3. To print/view files in an order, introduce Channels to communicate between the Goroutines.
    * Think about pagination later
