# Basic

## 1. Lab: Loops/Strings

Have the user enter a string, then loop through the string to generate a new string in which every character is duplicated, e.g., "hello" => "hheelllloo"

## 2. Lab: Loops

* Loop through the numbers from 2 to 25 and print out which numbers are prime, and for those numbers which are not prime numbers, you should print them as a product of two factors
* Remember that prime = no divisors other than 1 and itself
* Don't worry about efficiency, but if you're interested, check out math.Sqrt()
